# Weather App
The task was to create a weather app that would display values from an weather-API

## The problem
We started by following the instructions on the project. We decided to do our own design instead of using the example ones, in the end it contained all the functionality that were used in the example designs. 

We started with merging the branches that we had created when we followed the initial instructions, it went pretty well. There were only a few conflicts and they were resolved quickly. Then we created new branches and continued working with the CSS and functions for displaying the icon and temperatures properly. We merged those again. The second day was messy and we both worked in the master branch at coded together over Slack huddle, this was not a good idea. We should have divided up the work and stated clearly what each of us was supposed to do. Lesson learned! 

We struggled a lot with being able to display different CSS depending on what time of day it was. If we would have more time we would probably have been able to make it work. 

We added windspeed and a conditional statment that changes the icons change depending on what kind of weather it is. We added geolocation as and it worked for one of us but then we saw that it didn't work on every device we decided to change the location back to Stockholm.
